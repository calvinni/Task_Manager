How long did you spend on the coding test? 
Around 1 and a half days.

What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
I tend to not use new features of javascript as I use a lot of community packages with react native, some are old so it does not mesh well with newer code, with some new code like "toSort" or "toReversed" which creates a copy of an array after sorting/reversing. I like to stick with what I known but I keep in mind of new features when planning my development.
But the newest feature I used is error.cause for my catch error console logs as is useful all round to know more details of what and how the try function caught an error.

How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Currently, no as most of my projects are small in scope and hardly reach stress testing levels of causing my phone to lag.

If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
To better optimise the home.js code that fetch the cache data to input into a dict, due to how the react-native-cache storage works, the data is stored awkwardly in an array containing sub dict, maybe to change to another localstorage package.
For features, I would further improve the date system on tasks to a datetime system, thus allowing the user to choose specific time for which tasks need to be completed by.
